## Mental prep

Yesterday was chill, getting oriented and set up. Today, the firehose starts blasting. There will be *tons* of info, and you can expect to feel overwhelmed by it. That's okay, and even though you may not feel comfortable today, in a week or two you'll look back and this stuff will be a piece of cake. 

Remember:
1. ASK QUESTIONS. Ask for clarification or reiteration. I can repeat or say things another way if that will help. *Make your needs known.* If you have a question, I guarantee everyone else will benefit from it too. 
2. You will not retain everything in the lecture today. Rest assured you will be using and practicing the core concepts in the lab and each project moving forward. 

## HTML
### Build out an html document
- inside the `html` element we have a `head` and a `body`
    - The `head` tag contains information *about* the document
    - The `body` tag contains that content that the user will see on the page. 
- `head`
    - `meta` tags describe key data about the page
    - `title` tags give our page a title that shows up in chrome
    - `link` tags allow us to connect other file types, like the CSS that goes with our `html` file. 
- `body` 
    - Run the doc in the browser and show all the different types of elements shown in the slides. 
    - Opening/closing tags vs self closing
### Semantic HTML
    - Mostly using tags/elements that describe what their contents are
### Attributes
    - show different types of inputs
### Display value
    - `block` show divs and how they stack verticall
    - `inline` span, takes up only the content necessary for the contents
    - `inline-block` Cannot demonstrate this until CSS and selectors are used. `inline-block` simply allows you to add dimensions to an `inline` element.  

## CSS
### Selectors 
    - demo the four kinds of selectors 
### Ways to write CSS
    - Comment out the `link` and briefly show inline and internal
    - expound on the link and demonstrate
### CSS combinators
    - Throw in 5 or so `div`s inside of a `main` or section, with some `p` tags inside the divs. Go through the different combinators. 
 ### The Box Model  
    - Pick an element, give it an `id` and then add margin, border and padding. Show in inspector tool. 
### Box Sizing Properties 
    - Make the element 1000px wide, show how the total width of the box model is now much wider than 1000px.
    - Add `box-sizing: border-box` and show how all the parts of the box model now fit within our defined width.
